  <b>💁🏽‍♂️ How to use?</b>

  💬 Just send me your question and I will start a dialog with you.
  
  🚀 If you have a question on another topic, then start a <b>new dialog</b>. To do this, in the <b>Menu</b> select the command <b>Start New Dialog</b>.

  🤖 In order for me to give you more accurate answers, you can choose one of the available <b>chat modes</b>. You can view and select a chat mode through the <b>Menu</b> using the command <b>Select Chat Mode</b>. If none of the modes seemed suitable for you, just choose the <b>🧔🏽‍♂️ Assistant</b> mode, it is the very first one in the list.

  🏞️ In the <b>👨🏽‍🎨 Artist</b> mode, I can create pictures by text description. To do this, select the mode <b>👨🏽‍🎨 Artist</b> in the chat mode selection menu and send me a description of what you want to draw.

  🎤 You can send me <b>voice messages</b> instead of text. I will listen and answer your questions.

  ⏪ You can always go back to previous dialogues. To do this, simply answer my message from the desired dialogue and we will continue to communicate on that topic.

  🔄 If you are not satisfied with my answer, I can try to formulate the answer in a different way. To do this, select the <b>Menu</b> command <b>Regenerate Last Response</b>.

  💁🏽‍♂️ If you need help again, just select the command <b>Show Help</b> in the <b>Menu</b>.
