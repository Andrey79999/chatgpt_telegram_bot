  <b>💁 How to use?</b>

  💬 Just send me your question and I will start a dialog with you.
  
  🚀 If you have a question on another topic, then start a <b>new dialog</b>. To do this, in the <b>Menu</b> select the command <b>Start New Dialog</b>.

  🤖 To provide you with more precise responses, you have the option to select from the available <b>chat modes</b>. To view and choose a chat mode, access the <b>Menu</b> and use the command <b>Select Chat Mode</b>. In case none of the modes seem suitable, you can simply choose the <b>🤵‍♂️ General Assistant</b> mode, which is listed first.

  🏞️ In the <b>🧑‍🎨 Artist</b> mode, I can produce illustrations based on textual descriptions. To utilize this feature, select the <b>🧑‍🎨 Artist</b> mode from the chat mode selection menu and provide me with a description of the desired image.

  🎤 You have the option to send me <b>voice messages</b> instead of written text. I will attentively listen and provide responses to your inquiries.

  ⏪ It is always possible to revisit previous conversations. To do so, simply reply to my message from the relevant conversation and we will resume discussing the topic.

  🔄 If you are dissatisfied with my response, I can attempt to rephrase it differently. To do so, choose the <b>Regenerate Last Response</b> command from the <b>Menu</b>.

  💁 If you require assistance again, simply choose the command <b>Show Help</b> from the <b>Menu</b>.
